# 🐉 Dexhigh Dragon Battle Game

A Unity-based **2.5D top-down dragon combat game** developed as part of the **Junior Game Developer assessment task for Dexhigh Services Pvt. Ltd.**

The project features a battle between a **player-controlled dragon** and an **AI-controlled dragon**, inspired by tactical auto-battler games such as **TFT** and **Dota Underlords**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate foundational **Unity game development skills**, including:
- Scene and camera setup
- Player and AI combat mechanics
- Health and UI systems
- Visual effects and animations
- Clean code structure
- Effective usage of AI tools in development

---

## 🕹️ Game Features

### 🔥 Combat Abilities
Each dragon is equipped with three distinct abilities:
1. **Fire Attack** – Ranged fire-breath attack that inflicts damage  
2. **Tail Attack** – Close-range melee attack using the dragon’s tail  
3. **Fly Attack** – Dragon takes flight and attacks while airborne

### ❤️ Health System
- Health bars displayed for both player and AI dragons  
- Health updates dynamically during combat  

---

### 🏆 Win Condition
- When a dragon’s health reaches zero, a **Winner Screen** is displayed  
- The victorious dragon is clearly indicated  

---

## 🎥 Camera & Perspective
- **2.5D top-down camera angle**
- Designed to enhance visibility and tactical gameplay

---

## 🎨 Visuals & Effects
- Smooth character animations
- Fire particle effects
- Shadows and physics-based interactions
- Basic sound effects for attacks

---

## 🤖 AI Behavior
- AI-controlled dragon autonomously attacks the player
- Uses combat abilities based on range and conditions

---

## 🧠 AI Usage Note

AI tools were used during development to improve productivity and problem-solving:

- **ChatGPT**  
  - Assisted with Unity C# scripting logic  
  - Helped debug errors and optimize gameplay mechanics  
  - Provided guidance on AI behavior and UI systems  

These tools were used strictly as development aids, while all implementation, testing, and integration were performed manually.
